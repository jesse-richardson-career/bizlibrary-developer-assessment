  <h1>Developer Assessment</h1>

  <div id="questions">
    <h3>What is your favorite programming language, and why?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        My favorite language that I’ve learned recently is SASS. The ability to create CSS dynamically, use abstractions, and create code reuse is just such a powerful idea compared to vanilla CSS.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Tabs or spaces, and why?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        I usually prefer tabs, because I can select multiple lines of code at once and tab/untab them all at the same time. This allows me to align large blocks of code at once and that can be a great help with tidying up things.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Do you have a Stack Overflow account?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        No, I do not have a Stack Overflow account. I use Stack Overflow often, but usually my question has already been answered, or enough of an answer to get me pointed in the right direction.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>What does JSON stand for?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        JavaScript Object Notation
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="easter-egg">Bonus Question</h3>
    <div class="easter-egg">
      <p>
        My latest hobby is urban farming
      </p>

    <!-- Easter Egg: If you type out the Konami Code (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A) while viewing the page, you'll get a bonus question added to the list -->
